I'm excited to announce the first API designed for AI agents 
to provision on-demand ASL interpreters.

THE PROBLEM:
48 million Deaf and hard-of-hearing people in the US can't 
effectively use AI agents for phone calls, appointments, or 
customer service.

THE SOLUTION:
An API-first platform that lets AI agents programmatically 
request certified ASL interpreters with <10 second matching.

KEY FEATURES:
- Instant interpreter matching
- Blockchain-native payments ($ASL tokens)
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- Complete SDK with examples
- Enterprise-ready (webhooks, rate limiting, analytics)

This enables AI agents to be truly accessible to the Deaf 
community.

The full API specification is now open source:
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/asl-ai-agent-api

Looking for:
- Backend developers
- AI agent platform partnerships
- Beta testers
- Feedback from the accessibility community

Built by the Deaf community, for everyone.

Subject: ASL Interpretation API for Moltbook Agents

Hi Moltbook team,

I'm building the first API that enables AI agents to provide 
ASL interpretation for Deaf users.

48 million Deaf/hard-of-hearing people in the US currently 
can't effectively use AI agents for calls and appointments. 
This API solves that.

I've open-sourced the complete specification:
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/asl-ai-agent-api

Would love to discuss integrating with Moltbook agents.

Key features:
- <10 second interpreter matching
- Blockchain-native payments
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- Simple SDK integration

Happy to demo or answer questions.

Best,

**Text:**
```
I built an API that lets AI agents provision on-demand ASL 
interpreters for Deaf users.

Current VRI platforms require manual booking and take 15-30 
minutes. This API provides instant matching (<10s) with 
blockchain payments.

Built it because 48M Deaf/hard-of-hearing people can't 
effectively use AI agents today.

Open sourced the full spec. Looking for feedback and 
contributors.
